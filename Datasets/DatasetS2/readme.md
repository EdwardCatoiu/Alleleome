#### DatasetS2-Ecoli_genomes_and_allele_ids.xlsx.
This dataset includes a matrix (2661 strains x 4349 genes) that describes the specific nucleic acid allele id found in each strain for each open reading frame. It is the result of running the bidirectional best blast tool from RAST for 2661 strains to identify ORFs and their corresponding Blattner numbers in wild-type strains. This data is plotted in Fig. S1c and used in Fig S1d-f. More information is provided in the file.

##### NOTE:
Dataset S2 is divided into three files. Each file is named to reflect the range of strains that can be found within the files.
