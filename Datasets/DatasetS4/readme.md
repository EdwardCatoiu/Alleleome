#### DatasetS4-The_WT_alleleome_1_3M_AAs.xlsx.
This dataset is the E. coli wild-type alleleome and describes natural sequence variation found across 1.3 million codon positions. The number of strains carrying the dominant codon, dominant AA, variant codons, and variant AAs, are provided for each position. This data is plotted in Fig. 2, Fig. S3 and Fig. S7. More information is provided in the file.

##### NOTE:
Dataset S4 is divided into five files. Each file is named to reflect the range of amino acid positions that can be found within the files.
