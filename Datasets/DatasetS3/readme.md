#### DatasetS3-allele_sequences.zip.
This dataset describes the codon sequence, amino acid sequence, strain count, and QCQA decision for each allele found across 2661 strains described in Dataset S2. This data is plotted in Fig. S2 and used in Fig. S1d-f. More information is provided in the file. 

##### NOTE:
Dataset S3 is divided into four files. Each file is named to reflect the range of genes that can be found within the files.
